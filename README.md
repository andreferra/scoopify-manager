# scoopify

An ice cream shop manager

## Project Overview

Scoopify is a cross-platform Flutter application designed to manage
an ice cream shop. The project integrates with Firebase for user
authentication and cloud storage. It includes login and registration
screens backed by services that handle communication with Firebase.

The main code resides in the `lib/` directory:

- `main.dart` sets up Firebase and launches the app.
- `screens/` contains the sign-in and sign-up interfaces.
- `services/` implements authentication and storage logic.
- `models/` defines the application data structures.
